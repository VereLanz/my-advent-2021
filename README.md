# My Advent of Code 2021
Using the utility library [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data).

---
## Day 1 - Sonar Sweep (Seafloor Depth)
### Part One
You get a seafloor depth scan report. 
Find out how many measurements are larger (deeper) than the previous.

### Part Two
Group the seafloor depth scan values into groups of three (sum) and
find out how many measurement *groups* are larger (deeper) than the previous.



---
## Day 2 - Dive! (Submarine Steering)
### Part One
Follow the steering instructions given for your submarine (starting at (0, 0)) 
and multiply the final horizontal and vertical positions.

### Part Two
The steering works differently from what was assumed! 
The behaviours of the input commands have changed, calculate the positions anew.



---
## Day 3 - Binary Diagnostic (Submarine Diagnosing)
### Part One
Submarine diagnostic report gives you some binary numbers. Figure out the two needed
binary numbers by determining for each bit if more numbers in da report have a 0 or a 1
in that spot. Multiply those two resulting binaries for the submarine's 
power consumption.

### Part Two
From the diagnostic report, first filter out values step by step if they don't 
have the right bit. Then calculate the two new numbers like in Part One.
