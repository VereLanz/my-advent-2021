## Day 1
### *Sonar Sweep (Seafloor Depth)*
### Part One
You get a seafloor depth scan report. 
Find out how many measurements are larger (deeper) than the previous.

### Part Two
Group the seafloor depth scan values into groups of three (sum) and
find out how many measurement *groups* are larger (deeper) than the previous.

## Day 2
### *Dive! (Submarine Steering)*
### Part One
Follow the steering instructions given for your submarine (starting at (0, 0)) 
and multiply the final horizontal and vertical positions.

### Part Two
The steering works differently from what was assumed! 
The behaviours of the input commands have changed, calculate the positions anew.

## Day 3
### *Binary Diagnostic (Submarine Diagnosis)*
### Part One
The submarine's diagnostic report gives you some binary numbers. Figure out the two needed
binary numbers by determining for each bit if more numbers in da report have a 0 or a 1
in that spot. Multiply those two resulting binaries for the submarine's 
power consumption.

### Part Two
From the diagnostic report, first filter out values step by step if they don't 
have the right bit. Then calculate the two new numbers like in Part One.

## Day 4
### *Giant Squid (Squid Bingo)*
### Part One
You get some bingo boards and a list of numbers that will be drawn in order.
Figure out which of the boards will get bingo first and what its score 
(= sum of non-called numbers) will be.

### Part Two
On second thought you'd make sure that your opponent (a giant squid) wins,
so figure out which board will be the last to bingo and calculate it's score.

## Day 5
### *Hydrothermal Venture (Vent Grid)*
### Part One
You get coordinates of start and end points for hydrothermal vent lines.
First, figure out spots where at least two horizontal or vertical lines overlap.
(Asked is how many overlaps there are.)

### Part Two
Now also consider diagonal lines and again check where at least two lines overlap.

## Day 6
### *Lanternfish (Exponential Spawning)*
### Part One
You wonder how many lanternfish will be spawned after 80 days. Calculate this from
some estimated spawn timers and give a simulated number of how many fish there will be.

### Part Two
